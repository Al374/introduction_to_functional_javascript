# Hack Reactor: Functional Programming in JavaScript

Welcome to Hack Reactor's Functional Programming in JavaScript Mini Bootcamp. You're here to solidify your understanding of functional programming concepts and apply them in JavaScript. In today's session we'll be covering the following topics:

Each section consists of a lecture followed by a set of self-guided exercises. The self-guided exercises can be found in each section's respective folder in this repository. Before getting started, make sure that you have a JavaScript console open (like <a href="http://www.repl.it/languages/javascript" target="_blank">repl.it</a>), so you can complete all of the exercises.
